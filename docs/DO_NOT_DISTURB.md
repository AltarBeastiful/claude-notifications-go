# Do Not Disturb

The plugin plays its own audio cue, in its own process, rather than asking the
notification server to play one. That is what makes per-status sounds and volume
control possible — and it is also why, before this option existed, the MP3 played
at full volume while the desktop was in Do Not Disturb: the banner was correctly
queued and silenced by the desktop, but nothing had any say over a separate
process's audio.

`respectDoNotDisturb` closes that gap.

## Configuration

In `~/.claude/claude-notifications-go/config.json`:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "respectDoNotDisturb": "silent"
  }
}
```

| Value | Behaviour while DND is active |
|---|---|
| `"off"` (default) | Current behaviour. DND state is never queried, so the option costs nothing when it is not in use. |
| `"silent"` | The banner is still delivered — it lands in the notification centre and shows when DND lifts — but the plugin's own sound is not played. |
| `"suppress"` | Nothing is delivered: no banner, no sound. |

Webhooks are unaffected in all three modes. DND is a statement about *this*
desktop's attention, not about your team's Slack channel.

DND is read at delivery time, after any `notifyDelaySeconds` wait, so switching
DND on during the grace period is honoured.

### Why the default is `"off"`

Playing audio through DND is the bug, so "respect DND" arguably belongs on by
default. Two things argue against flipping it:

- A silent behaviour change on upgrade is a surprise. `notifyOnlyWhenUnfocused`
  shipped as `false` for the same reason.
- On KDE, `org.freedesktop.Notifications.Inhibited` is **also** true when an
  *application* requests inhibition — fullscreen video, screen sharing,
  presentation mode — not only when you toggle DND by hand. That is arguably the
  right semantics, but a default-on version could swallow cues during a
  fullscreen video, and a missing cue is a much worse failure than an extra one.

### The terminal bell is not muted

In `"silent"` mode the terminal bell (`terminalBell`, on by default) still fires.
BEL is a *tab indicator* on Ghostty, tmux and Windows Terminal — visual for most
users — and whether it is audible at all is already your terminal's own setting.
In `"suppress"` mode it does not fire, because the notification is dropped before
the notifier is reached. Set `"terminalBell": false` if you want it gone entirely.

## Detection fails open

Detection returns "in DND" **only** on positive confirmation. Any D-Bus error,
unsupported desktop, missing daemon, timeout, or unparseable value is treated as
"unknown", which means the notification and its sound are delivered exactly as
before.

This bias is deliberate, and it is what makes the option safe to enable: a wrong
"in DND" result silently swallows a cue you are waiting for, whereas a wrong "not
in DND" result merely plays one sound you did not want. The failure mode is
always an extra sound, never a missing notification.

## What is detected, per platform

### Linux

| Desktop / daemon | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| KDE Plasma (and any daemon implementing that part of the freedesktop spec) | `org.freedesktop.Notifications.Inhibited` (D-Bus property) | Also true for application-requested inhibition — fullscreen video, screen sharing. |
| dunst | `paused` property on the `org.dunstproject.cmd0` interface, same bus name and object path | Matches `dunstctl set-paused`. |
| XFCE | `xfce4-notifyd` / `/do-not-disturb` via `org.xfce.Xfconf.GetProperty` | Only queried when the desktop is XFCE. |
| GNOME (and Unity) | `gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners` | The key is inverted: `false` means DND. GNOME exposes no DND property on D-Bus, so this is the one probe that costs a subprocess; it only runs when the desktop is GNOME. |

Any positive signal wins; sources that cannot be read are skipped.

Not covered yet: notification daemons that expose DND only through their own
private interface and do not implement `Inhibited` — for example swaync
(`org.erikreider.swaync`) and mako. Adding one is a new reader in
`internal/notifier/dnd_linux.go` plus a case in `evaluateDND`; the same fail-open
rule applies, so an unrecognised daemon is never worse than today.

### macOS and Windows — not implemented

Both report "not in DND", so `respectDoNotDisturb` currently has no effect there:
notifications and their sounds are delivered exactly as before, in every mode.
The same underlying bug exists on both platforms — the plugin plays its own
sound, and the macOS Swift notifier is already invoked with `-nosound` — so this
is worth doing, but not worth guessing at:

- **macOS.** `defaults -currentHost read com.apple.notificationcenterui doNotDisturb`
  stopped being authoritative in Ventura, which replaced Do Not Disturb with
  Focus modes. The live state lives in `~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/Assertions.json`
  and `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ncprefs.plist`. Both are undocumented and
  version-fragile, and a detector that is wrong in the "in DND" direction
  silently swallows notifications — the one failure mode this feature must not
  have. It needs its own testing across OS versions, in its own change.
- **Windows.** Focus Assist / quiet hours, via
  `WNF_SHEL_QUIET_MOMENT_SHELL_MODE_CHANGED` or the registry under
  `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings`.
  `git.sr.ht/~jackmordaunt/go-toast` is already a dependency but does not expose
  it.

Both slot into the existing shape: add `internal/notifier/dnd_darwin.go` or
`dnd_windows.go` with a `desktopIsDoNotDisturb()` and narrow the build tag on
`dnd_other.go` accordingly. No change to the config, hook, or notifier API is
needed.

## Latency

The probe runs on the hook path, which is latency-critical, so it is bounded:

- D-Bus property reads are sub-millisecond and always run.
- One `NameHasOwner` check gates the notification-daemon probes, so an absent
  daemon costs one fast round trip instead of two full timeouts — and the probe
  never D-Bus-activates a daemon as a side effect of asking it a question.
- The `gsettings` subprocess (~50–150ms) runs **only** on GNOME.
- Hard caps: 400ms per D-Bus call, 1s for the `gsettings` call, 1.5s for the
  whole probe. On expiry the probe reports "not in DND" and delivery proceeds.
- Nothing is queried at all while `respectDoNotDisturb` is `"off"`, and nothing
  is queried when the notification was already suppressed by
  `notifyOnlyWhenUnfocused`.

The session bus connection is private and closed when the probe returns, and it
is opened with the no-autostart variant so a session without a bus cannot cause
`dbus-launch` to spawn a stray daemon.

## Checking it yourself

Read the KDE / freedesktop property directly:

```bash
gdbus call --session \
  --dest org.freedesktop.Notifications \
  --object-path /org/freedesktop/Notifications \
  --method org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get \
  org.freedesktop.Notifications Inhibited
```

Toggle DND from your notification applet and re-run: it should flip
`<<true>>`/`<<false>>`. Start a fullscreen video and re-run to see the
application-inhibition case described above.

The equivalents for the other sources:

```bash
dunstctl is-paused
xfconf-query -c xfce4-notifyd -p /do-not-disturb
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners   # false means DND
```

With debug logging enabled, the plugin logs which source fired:

```
DND: active (org.freedesktop.Notifications.Inhibited)
DND: active (dunst paused)
DND: active (xfce4-notifyd do-not-disturb)
DND: active (GNOME show-banners=false)
```

If the outcome looks right but the source is not the one you expect, the
detection is wrong even though the result happens to match.
